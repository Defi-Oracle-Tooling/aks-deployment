## Quota Request Status

All requested quota increases have been approved as of March 21, 2025. Currently, we have sufficient CPU quota across all regions for the initial deployment of validator nodes.

## Justification for the DS_v4 Series

The recommended instance type is Standard D16S_v5, with an upgrade path to D32S_v5 and then D64S_v5. More optimal choices with better memory options include the FS_v2 and E_v2 VMs. The DS_v4 series was chosen as the starting point due to a balance of total enabled regions and system requirements.

## Future Pathway Forward

In addition to the validation nodes, which are Azure Kubernetes clusters, there are member nodes, boot nodes, and other networking and structural components to consider. A well-architected design is essential for the continued success of this digital currency and digital trade telecommunications network, which forms the foundation of SolaceNet.
