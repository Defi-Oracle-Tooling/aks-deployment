# Master Configurator

## Introduction
The Master Configurator is an overarching tool that integrates various configurators (such as Blockchain Configurator, Cloud Provider Configurator, GitHub Configurator, and Industry Clouds Configurator) to provide a unified configuration solution.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Integrate multiple configurators into a single interface.
- Provide a seamless user experience across different configurators.
- Support for combined configurations and recommendations.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Security and privacy of configurations.
- Scalability to handle multiple configurators.
- High availability and reliability.

## System Design
### Architecture
- High-level architecture diagram.
- Components and their interactions.

### Data Flow
- Data flow diagrams illustrating how data moves through the system.

### User Interface
- Wireframes or mockups of the user interface.

## Development Plan
