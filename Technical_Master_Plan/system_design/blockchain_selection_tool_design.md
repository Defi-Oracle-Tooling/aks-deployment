# Blockchain Selection Tool System Design

## 1. System Overview

The Blockchain Selection Tool helps users determine the most appropriate blockchain platform for their specific use cases based on various criteria such as performance requirements, security needs, governance models, and more.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

### 2.2 Component Interactions

- **Web Interface**: User-friendly questionnaire and requirement input forms
- **Selection Engine**: Core logic that matches requirements to blockchain capabilities
- **Blockchain Knowledge Base**: Database of blockchain platforms and their characteristics
- **Recommendation Generator**: Creates detailed recommendations with justifications

## 3. Data Flow

### 3.1 Selection Process Flow

1. User inputs requirements and project characteristics
2. System evaluates inputs against blockchain capabilities matrix
3. Selection engine applies weighted scoring to potential matches
4. System generates ranked recommendations with pros/cons
5. User can explore detailed comparisons between top recommendations
6. Selected recommendation can be passed to the Blockchain Configurator

### 3.2 Data Models

#### Requirement Input Schema
```json
{
  "performanceNeeds": {
    "transactionsPerSecond": "number",
    "latencyTolerance": "string"
  },
  "securityRequirements": {
    "permissioned": "boolean",
    "immutabilityLevel": "string",
    "privacyRequirements": "string"
  },
  "governance": {
    "decentralizationLevel": "string",
    "upgradeFrequency": "string"
  },
  "complianceNeeds": ["string"],
  "budgetConstraints": "string"
}
```

## 4. User Interface

### 4.1 Wireframes

The UI consists of:
- Requirements questionnaire with progressive disclosure
- Visual comparison matrix of blockchain options
- Detailed blockchain platform information pages
- Recommendation results with visual scoring
- Export and sharing options for results

### 4.2 User Experience Flow

```
Start → Answer Requirements Questionnaire → View Recommendations → 
Compare Options → Select Platform → Export or Continue to Configuration
```

## 5. Knowledge Base Design

### 5.1 Blockchain Evaluation Criteria

The knowledge base includes comprehensive data on blockchain platforms:
- Performance metrics (TPS, latency, finality)
- Consensus mechanisms and security features
- Smart contract capabilities
- Enterprise readiness features
- Community and ecosystem support
- Operational costs and resource requirements
- Integration capabilities

## 6. Recommendation Algorithm

- Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach
- Weighted scoring based on user-prioritized requirements
- Compatibility filtering to eliminate unsuitable options early
- Confidence scoring for recommendations based on input completeness

## 7. Integration Points

- Integration with Blockchain Configurator for seamless transition to deployment
- API endpoints for programmatic recommendation queries
- Export functionality to PDF reports and comparison charts
- Feedback loop to improve recommendation accuracy over time

## 8. Maintenance Plan

- Regular updates to the blockchain knowledge base
- Performance metrics verification with benchmarking
- New blockchain platform addition process
- User feedback collection and analysis
