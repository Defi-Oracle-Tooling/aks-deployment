## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Handling Deployment Failures**
- Errors are logged in `failed_regions.log`.
- Azure Monitor alerts are triggered for failures.
- Partially created resources are cleaned up.

# AKS Deployment Script

## Overview
This script deploys Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to multiple regions as specified in `regions.txt`.

## New Features
- **State Management:** The script now records successfully deployed regions in `success_regions.log` and skips them in subsequent runs.
- **Pre-Deployment Check:** The script checks if the AKS cluster already exists and is healthy before attempting deployment.
- **Logging:** The script logs detailed deployment process in `deployment.log`.
- **Cleanup:** The script cleans up partially created resources in case of deployment failures.
- **Notification:** The script notifies the team about the deployment status, including both successes and failures.
- **Cleanup:** The script provides a unified cleanup mechanism to remove resources in case of deployment failures. The cleanup functionality:
  - Is centralized in the `scripts/deployment/deployment-utils.sh` file
  - Can remove entire resource groups or individual resources
  - Logs all cleanup operations to the audit log
  - Is used by both the deployment and rollback scripts
  - Handles both resource group level and specific resource cleanup
  - Logs all cleanup operations to the audit log
  - Is centralized in the deployment-utils.sh file for consistent behavior
  - Can be triggered automatically on failure or manually through dedicated commands

## Usage
1. Ensure `regions.txt` contains the list of regions to deploy to.
2. Run the deployment script:
    ```bash
    ./deploy.sh
    ```
3. Review `success_regions.log` for successfully deployed regions, `failed_regions.log` for any failures, and `deployment.log` for detailed deployment process.

## Files
- `regions.txt`: List of regions to deploy to.
- `success_regions.log`: Records regions that were successfully deployed.
- `failed_regions.log`: Records regions where deployment failed.
- `deployment.log`: Logs detailed deployment process.

## Prerequisites
- Azure CLI must be installed and authenticated.
- Ensure the necessary permissions to create and manage AKS clusters.

## Notes
- The script will skip regions listed in `success_regions.log`.
- If a region's AKS cluster is already healthy, it will be skipped and recorded in `success_regions.log`.
- The script cleans up partially created resources in case of deployment failures.
- The script notifies the team about the deployment status, including both successes and failures.
