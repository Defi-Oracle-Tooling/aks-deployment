## Justification for the DS_v4 Series

The recommended instance type is Standard D16S_v5, with an upgrade path to D32S_v5 and then D64S_v5. More optimal choices with better memory options include the FS_v2 and E_v2 VMs. The DS_v4 series was chosen as the starting point due to a balance of total enabled regions and system requirements.

## Future Pathway Forward

In addition to the validation nodes, which are Azure Kubernetes clusters, there are member nodes, boot nodes, and other networking and structural components to consider. A well-architected design is essential for the continued success of this digital currency and digital trade telecommunications network, which forms the foundation of SolaceNet.
